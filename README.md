# Overview

This repositpry contains code for a very simple chass game that can be played in terminal.

My goal in writing this software was to simply learn how to code in the java programming langauge. With this project I wanted to not only expand my programming language repetoire, but also improve my ability to learn future languages. With this project I got the opportunity to hone my skills when it comes to learning how to code in a quick and efficient fashion.

Below is a video overviewing this project and how it works.

# Future Work

This software was an entirely introductory experience to java, so it is extremely bare bones and requires a lot of changes to be a software that could really be considered a deliverable. Some of these changes would be as follows:
- Logic handling. A lot of issues came up with this project regarding logic about the actual game of chess, but unfortunately, my goal in creating this game wasn't to create a perfectly functioning chess game, it was something that I wanted to do to learn java, so much of the logic was left up to the user. In the future I would like to take away a lot of the user agency that was required to overcome logic issues and instead have a streamlined game.
- Bug fixes. The biggest issue of logic handling was giving to much player agency, and because of this, there is ample room for users to break the game if they do not follow the exact rules of chess.
- UI improvement. The UI for this game is incredibly basic. It was created with the bare minimum in mind. If I were to improve this game anymore past just a fully functional terminal game, I would like to give an actual user interface that makes for a better playing experience.
